# Reactions

One of the hottest feature of <ToughZone /> certainly is the reaction feature.

Enable your audience to react to your show using the reaction toolbar directly beneath the stream
container. Reactions can be used in many ways - the most apparent is an animation that lets the
emoji fly through the video - the more people use the same reaction, the more emojis are animated.

Besides that, reactions are ready to be integrated into show automation - trigger media servers,
lights, audio, video in the studio in real time. Teased? Contact us today.

## Default reactions

We provide the following reactions ready to use with each <ToughZone /> instance. They are taken 
from [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) - Twitter's implementation of the Emoji standard.

## Custom reactions

There are two ways to get custom emojis working:

### Use additional twemojis

If there are twemoijs that you want to use that are not yet included in
[default reactions](#default-reactions) just tell us the codes and we are happy to set them up.

To get a list of available twemojis and their codes, just use
[this cheatsheet](https://twemoji-cheatsheet.vercel.app) by 
[Shahriar Khalvati](https://github.com/shahriarkh).

### Your own emojis

Your own emojis are also easy to implement - they just have to follow these rules:

* `PNG` image
* 72x72px in size
