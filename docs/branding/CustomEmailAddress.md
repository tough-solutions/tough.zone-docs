# Custom Email Address

When using your <ToughZone />, we will need to send transactional emails to your users used for e.g.
verification, password reset, welcome emails and the like.

By default, we are sending these emails from `Your Company Name <noreply@tough.zone>`. But it is
also possible to use custom sender addresses, depending on your needs.

To make this possible, you will first have to decide, which address you would like to use and then
which of the both methods described below would fit your needs in terms of compliance, flexibility
and features.

We do not offer mailboxes, so if you do not maintain a properly configured mailbox for the address
you desire, emails directed to that address are bounced by the outbound MTA of the sender and will
not be delivered anywhere.

For technical details refer to [this page](/technical/CustomEmailAddress.md).
