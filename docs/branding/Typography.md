# Typography

<ToughZone /> uses the [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font throughout the page.

The font is hosted on and served from the instance to facilitate GDPR compliance.

There are four font weights being used, we call them `medium`, `semibold`, `bold` and `extrabold`.
If you want to use a custom font, we will need `.woff2` files for each of those font weights.
