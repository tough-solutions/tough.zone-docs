# Custom Email Templates

While we provide a sleek and clean default email template that should fit most needs, email
templates are of course customizable.

## Email header

We can include a custom email header in your emails which should have following specifications:

* `600 x X px`<br />
  `X` can be used for managing proportions. Generally around 150 px look good but it depends on the
  overall design of the image
* JPG or PNG

Alternatively to keep it simple, we will be using your [client logo](ClientLogo.md) in the email
header. We would recommend a size of `143 x X px` for that.
